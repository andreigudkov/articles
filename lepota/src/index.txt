Pierre drove to Marya Dmitrievna's to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish
that Kuragin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in a state of
alarm and commotion. +Natasha+ was *very ill*, having, as +Marya Dmitrievna+
told him in secret, *poisoned herself* the night after she had been told that
+Anatole+ was *married*, with some arsenic she had 'stealthily' procured. After
swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke Sonya and told her
what she had done. The necessary *antidotes* had been *administered* in time and
she was now 'out of danger', though still so 'weak' that it was out of the
question to move her to the country, and so the countess had been sent for.
+Pierre+ saw the 'distracted' count, and +Sonya+, who had a 'tear-stained' face,
but he could not see Natasha. footnote:[Move along, nothing to see here]

Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the
attempted abduction of Rostova. He resolutely denied these rumors, assuring
everyone that nothing had happened except that his brother-in-law had proposed
to her and been refused. It seemed to Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the
whole affair and re-establish Natasha's reputation.

Implementation note: this implementation provides O(log(n)) time for the
enqueing and dequeing methods (+offer+, +poll+, +remove()+ and +add+); linear
time for the +remove(Object)+ and +contains(Object)+ methods; and constant time
for the retrieval methods (+peek+, +element+, and +size+).
