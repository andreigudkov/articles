<h1>Scrum dysfunction</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since scrum became the dominating religion in software engineering.
Adjacent industries are slowly adopting it, too.
What are the reasons behind its such immense popularity?
Cost of development?
Ability to change requirements on the fly?
Or maybe the product quality?
Unfortunately, creations are rarely liked for what their inventors expect them to be liked for,
and scrum is not the exception.
Let&#8217;s look at the true reasons that make scrum so popular.
As you have already guessed from the title, they are not genuinely good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>1. Evading responsibility</strong><br>
Responsibility is rarely a pleasant thing.
Nobody likes to work on boring tasks, tasks which are too hard or too simple,
tasks with unpredictable time estimation or tasks which are liability rather than increasing product value.
But scrum&#8217;s approach to manage people as being interchangeable provides wide range of tools to evade responsibility.
You can extract unpleasant part of your task into separate task and assign it to someone else.
You can build a prototype (the most rewarding part of the work), and, after declaring that here "everything is already done"
and "only <em>minor</em> polishing remains" get the bonus and move to another project.
Or you can hide yourself behind the myriad of trivial dependencies.
Result is always the same: the collection of the most unpleasant (and, ironically, important)
tasks jumps from a person to a person and from iteration to iteration until they become irrelevant.
But the key goal&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;evading responsibility&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is achieved.
Welcome to comfort zone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2. Visible artifacts</strong><br>
Scrum naturally generates immense amount of highly visible artifacts:
bugtracker issues and sub-issues, sprint boards, whiteboards entirely covered with colored sticky notes,
frequent noisy stand-ups and meetings&#8230;&#8203;
When you enter office space, it becomes immediately obvious that people are doing something <em>important</em>.
Visible artifacts are crucial when you work on an outsourced project ordered by external customer.
The same is true if you work for company where IT is one of many auxiliary departments
with primary goal of supporting core business.
In both cases, people who fund the project have zero understanding of software engineering.
Visible artifacts are the only unarguable means of proving that the project is moving forward.
The results of the project are of secondary importance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>3. Fast career progression</strong><br>
Have you always been dreaming of managing a huge project with hundreds of subordinates,
but the only thing you&#8217;ve got so far is supporting single-page web site?
Don&#8217;t worry!
With scrum&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;by clever applying micromanagement, bureaucracy and people blending tools&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you will be able to always easily justify the necessity of more employees.
Split project into five-minute long tasks, add twenty required fields to your bugtracker,
hold at least four meetings per day, and regularly switch people between the components.
All this guarantees that the project won&#8217;t be on schedule anymore.
Ninety percent of the time will be occupied by <em>supporting</em> scrum process.
Project won&#8217;t move towards its goal anymore.
Now you can prepare pessimistic forecast (visible artificats are very helpful at this point!),
go to your managers and easily persuade them to hire more people.
Scrum is a truly <em>agile</em> methodology in this sense.
I wonder whether the term "agile" itself comes from the fact that any methodology of such type
is able to bloat any&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no matter how small&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;project to the extent of the universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>4. Hiding incompetence</strong><br>
Scrum is the easiest way for a person without required skills to enter software engineering industry
and gain its benefits.
Try the role of a scrum master.
This is not too hard.
You don&#8217;t need to understand the technical details of the project.
The only thing you really need to do is to rigorously follow scrum process:
fill in iterations with tasks, shift priorities up and down, gather daily meetings and use a lot of scrum-related buzzwords.
This by itself will be more than enough to create an aura of high importance around you.
You can work for a year and even don&#8217;t know what the project is all about.
After you have been accepted by the team, you can start hiring people you like.
This should be preferably an army of loyal idiots, so that they would be in the same boat as you.
Scrum approach of mixing people and tasks at microlevel will make it impossible to distinguish
between genuine contributors and those who were hired to support manager&#8217;s self-esteem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>5. Job security</strong><br>
Scrum, being a micromanagement-based methodology, naturally blends people with different
qualifications and roles.
This blend is miscible to such extent that it is not possible to reliably distinguish between
key people and those who can be removed without failing the project.
Even if your company faces bad times and an external manager is summoned to reduce the costs of your project,
the only thing this outsider will be able to do is to replace the whole team,
which most likely will be considered too dangerous to do.
Hence, your team survives and becomes irreplaceable as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>6. Scrum is a formal methodology</strong><br>
Solving problems which do not have ready by the book solutions results in lack of confidence and, consequently, to stress.
You have to answer yourself a lot of questions everyday.
"How often should we make releases?
Did we estimate effort reasonably?
How to explain that we need to remake everything?
And whom should we blame for the project failure?"
Two steps ahead, one step behind.
With scrum, you can at least stop worrying about how the process is organized.
The only thing you really need to do is to visit nearby book shop and buy any modern book on scrum.
No more decisions out of thin air: step by step instruction is provided by the book.
You can&#8217;t be blamed for misorganization, you can rely on scrum book to justify all your decisions.
"According to this book, the experts on scrum recommend that this be done exactly this way.
Do you really think that they are wrong? In this case, talk to them, not me."
No more hard thinking.
Atop of that, you can compare your "scrum level" with colleagues
and even complete training courses and earn the title "certified scrum master".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more scrum projects I encounter, the more I become confident that "scrum" is an umbrella term
for superficial, toy projects with constantly growing micromanagement and chaos.
If I had to choose only single word to describe scrum, then it would be "kindergarten".
Any traditional best practice integrated into scrum process transforms into a child&#8217;s play:
it still has all external attributes of the former but lacks the very essence.
Code review boils down to checking indentation,
meetings&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to half-day long discussions of how to name a class,
testing is limited to verifying the primary use case,
and the remainder of the day is dedicated to solving the easiest problem you&#8217;ve managed to secure for yourself.
All these activities are fake and do not contribute to the welfare of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How did it happen that scrum managed to stick to software engineering,
where the fundamental principle "high cohesion, loose coupling" was born?
I think that the answer to this question is the ongoing simplification of the industry,
shift from full-scale development towards building small linear combinations over 3rd-party components.
Neither long-term commitment nor deep immersion are required in such setup.
When you have such type of project, any methodology works, even the absence of thereof.
But it is the scrum that creates the best possible cover-up among all existing methodologies
for an army of opportunistic managers who were attracted to software engineering industry by high salaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum doesn&#8217;t work for projects which require hard effort.
Its focus on short, well-defined tasks and zero personal responsibility
make it impossible to finish any poorly predictable project, for example, relying on deep development or research.
Here scrum again proves that it is an <em>agile</em> methodology (though the term "slimy" would be more appropriate):
it encourages to stick to the easiest, tastiest problems and ignore anything harder than that.
As such, every project infected with scrum eventually transforms into the pipeline that copy-pastes
simple by-the-book solutions.
It is very frustrating to observe a fresh project with novel idea slowly dying
after scrum has been introduced into it.
The key idea of the project is dropped halfway,&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;"but don&#8217;t worry, we instead made this beautiful UI based on the
state-of-the-art JS framework".
Beautiful UI alone is hard to sell, project stagnates, participants scatter,
and managers search for a new host to infect with scrum.
In the long run, only the managers benefit from scrum, but not the ordinary team members and not the project as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All successful, long-lived projects that I encountered relied on splitting project
into non-overlapping areas of responsibility with full private ownership.
This is the key factor to well-being of the project.
There should be only single responsible person for any component, and this person should be the sole owner
of this component at the same time.
Owner acts like mother and father of the component: designs it, builds it, supports it, milks it.
Relationship between project participants should be by means of agreed API, such as header files
and communication protocols, or by means of agreed data scheme in case you are dealing with data analysis.
These are the perfect split points: they allow to smoothly connect components together
and hide their internal complexity inside the minds of their respective owners at the same time.
Implementation details of each separate component are entirely under control of the component&#8217;s owner
(restricted by project-wide rules, of course).
In such organizational setup, manager&#8217;s job is to hire best possible people, split project into components
(this is hard!) and leave people alone.
After that is done, people can work without constant supervision, and manager can focus
on "outside" aspects of the project, such as budget, politics and long-term plans,
thus securing bright future for the whole team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only after granting full ownership you can demand that people take responsibility for what they do.
In general, the benefits of private ownership cover much wider range than that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>it guarantees that unpleasant tasks will be done and not indefinitely reassigned from a person to a person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it ensures quality: experienced people are motivated to work on their own components and not the shared trash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it gives the manager much time to focus on the "outside" of the project rather than the "inside"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it scales well thanks to small number of interpersonal dependencies; teams of hundreds of members are not the exception</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it allows to work remotely (for the same reason)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it encourages experimenting: working on ideas which are well accepted only after they have been implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it ensures that every team member uses accustomed and, thus, the most efficient tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is transparent: bottlenecks are identified at early stage, so that the adjustments can be made in time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it reduces number of conflicts of interest to a bare minimum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>components built by a single person can be easily handed over due to high quality, clear interface and uniform style</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum, on the other hand, perfectly inverses these benefits.
If private ownership can be considered an instance of divide and conquer approach, then scrum is an instance
of "entangle and enjoy the chaos" approach.
And I can hardly imagine any uses of it except for personal benefit.
So, if you are on the bright side of the world, I suggest that you stay away from scrum as well as from its advocates.
Learn to value private ownership instead.
It is much more efficient and rewarding.</p>
